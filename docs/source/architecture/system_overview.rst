System Overview
===============

Requirements and design goals
------------------------------

The design of PROTEA is governed by five requirements derived from the
limitations of its predecessors (PIS and FANTASIA):

**R1 — Reproducibility**
   A prediction produced today must be exactly reproducible in the future.
   This requires recording the ontology version, reference annotation set, and
   embedding model configuration used for every prediction run.

**R2 — Scalability**
   The system must handle reference sets of hundreds of thousands of proteins
   and query sets of thousands without holding all data in memory simultaneously.

**R3 — Separation of concerns**
   Domain logic (what to compute), execution flow (how jobs are dispatched and
   tracked), and infrastructure (database, message queue) must be independently
   replaceable.

**R4 — Observability**
   Every job must produce a structured audit trail so that failures can be
   diagnosed without replaying the computation.

**R5 — Accessibility**
   Researchers without machine-learning infrastructure expertise must be able
   to submit sequences and retrieve predictions through a web interface or a
   REST API.

Runtime stack
-------------

PROTEA runs as a set of cooperative processes managed by ``scripts/manage.sh``:

Services and data stores
------------------------

**FastAPI (port 8000)**

   RESTful HTTP API. Handles job creation, status queries, event retrieval, and
   cancellation. On ``POST /jobs``, it creates a ``Job`` row in QUEUED status, commits,
   then publishes the job UUID to RabbitMQ. The session factory and AMQP URL are injected
   via ``app.state`` at startup, keeping the router free of global state.

**RabbitMQ (port 5672 / 15672)**

   Message broker. Standard queues carry the job UUID — all state lives in PostgreSQL.
   Ephemeral batch queues carry the full operation payload (no DB row per message).
   Durable queues ensure messages survive broker restarts.

          ``generate_evaluation_set``, ``run_cafa_evaluation``,
          ``train_reranker``, ``train_reranker_auto``
      * - ``protea.embeddings``
        - QueueConsumer
        - ``compute_embeddings`` coordinator (serialised: one at a time, 60 s retry delay if GPU busy)
      * - ``protea.embeddings.batch``
        - OperationConsumer
        - ``compute_embeddings_batch`` — GPU inference per batch (ephemeral, no DB Job row)
      * - ``protea.embeddings.write``
        - OperationConsumer
        - ``store_embeddings`` — bulk pgvector insert (ephemeral, no DB Job row)
      * - ``protea.predictions.batch``
        - OperationConsumer
        - ``predict_go_terms_batch`` — KNN search + GO transfer (ephemeral, no DB Job row)
      * - ``protea.predictions.write``
        - OperationConsumer
        - ``store_predictions`` — bulk GOPrediction insert (ephemeral, no DB Job row)

**QueueConsumer vs OperationConsumer**

   Two consumer patterns exist in ``protea/infrastructure/queue/consumer.py``:

   - **QueueConsumer** — reads a job UUID from the queue, delegates to ``BaseWorker.handle_job()``.
     Creates a full Job row with status transitions and event log.
   - **OperationConsumer** — reads a raw operation payload from the queue and executes it directly.
     Used for high-throughput batch workers where creating thousands of child Job rows would cause
     queue bloat. Progress is tracked at the parent level only.

**Worker processes**

   Long-running Python processes, one per queue. Launched and managed by ``scripts/manage.sh``.
   Workers reconnect automatically on broker disconnection and can be scaled horizontally:

   .. code-block:: bash

      bash scripts/manage.sh scale protea.predictions.batch 2   # add 2 more batch workers

**PostgreSQL + pgvector (port 5432)**

   Persistent store for all state. Holds job queues, event logs, protein sequences,
   UniProt metadata, GO ontologies, annotation sets, sequence embeddings (pgvector),
   and GO predictions. SQLAlchemy 2.x ORM with ``Mapped[]`` annotations.

   .. note::
      pgvector is used only for **storage** of embeddings (VECTOR type columns).
      KNN search is performed in Python using numpy or FAISS, never at the DB layer.
      See :ref:`knn-constraint` in the howto guides.

**Next.js frontend (port 3000)**

   Single-page application for job management. Displays job list with status filtering,
   live auto-refresh (2 s polling while a job is active), progress bar, and structured
   event timeline. Built with React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4.

Stack management
----------------

All processes are managed through ``scripts/manage.sh``:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash scripts/manage.sh start [N]          # start full stack (N batch workers per pipeline)
   bash scripts/manage.sh stop               # stop all processes
   bash scripts/manage.sh status             # show PID, RAM, running/dead per worker
   bash scripts/manage.sh logs [name]        # tail logs (interactive picker or name fragment)
   bash scripts/manage.sh scale <queue> [N]  # add N extra workers to a queue without restart

Logs are written to ``logs/<name>.log``. PIDs are tracked in ``logs/pids/``.

All Python dependencies are declared in ``pyproject.toml`` with pinned version
ranges; ``poetry.lock`` guarantees reproducible installs. The ``dev`` dependency
group adds pytest, pytest-cov, and related tooling without affecting production.

Testing strategy
----------------

The test suite is split into two categories:

**Unit tests**
   Run with plain ``pytest``. Mock external services (HTTP, RabbitMQ) and use
   minimal fixtures. Cover operation logic, alignment and taxonomy utilities,
   FASTA parsing, and API router behaviour. Currently **283 tests passing**
   across 17 test files; coverage enforced at 70 % by ``pytest-cov``.

**Integration tests**
   Run with ``pytest --with-postgres``. The ``conftest.py`` fixture pulls a
   ``pgvector/pgvector:pg16`` Docker image, initialises the schema, and tears
   down the container after the session. These tests exercise the full
   round-trip from job submission to database state.

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry run pytest                   # unit tests only
   poetry run pytest --with-postgres   # full suite including integration tests
